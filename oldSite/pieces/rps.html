		Over the summer of 2013, I interned as a User Experience Design intern at <a href="http://www.sundriessolutions.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylaunch">Viget Labs</a> in Boulder, CO. Part of Viget's internship program required the interns in each of the company's three offices collaborate on a group project.
    </p>
    
    <p class="margintopparagraph">
        In the Boulder office, my intern group was made up of myself, a front-end development intern, and a back-end development intern. We chose to build a Rock Paper Scissors game. The project proved to be a very interesting UX design challenge as it was not a typical website.

         Our idea was to implement the game in phases, starting with the ability to play against a computer and then adding in the ability to play against other humans. We started by writing up User Stories to figure out what a user would be able to do with our app in each phase we would implement. 
     </p>
        <p class="margintopparagraph">To figure out how a user would progress through a game, I began white-boarding user flow diagrams. I then transferred the diagrams into Omnigraffle and then worked to refine them by adding specific annotations and details about each step in the process.</p>

    <h3 class="process"> Wireframes </h3>
    <br>

    <p>
    Because of the five phase implementation plan for our project, I found it easiest to create small simplified wireframes for each screen state a user would encounter as they made their way through the game. By doing this, I was also able to list out all of the specific features that would be available within a screen. These became a good reference for both our front-end and back-end devs.

    <p>
    As we moved into the front-end development of the game, I created more detailed wireframes that featured my concepts for various animations. By showing these actions through wireframes, I was able tow work with Samii (FED) to create the animations featured in our game.        </p>

    <p>
    Our group, lacking a dedicated design intern, sought help from Viget designer Steve Schoeffel for the visual design of the project. We decided that we wanted to go for a flat cartoonish look and also wanted to include a bit of Boulder in the project (the Flatirons and Chautauqua Park). With our mood boards and after several conversations, Steve was able to create Photoshop comps that I then modified as needed to fit the different screen states necessary for front-end dev.
