		During the summer of 2012, I spent six weeks studying abroad in Letterkenny, County Donegal, Ireland with the <a href="http://ohioireland.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" class="launch">Documentary Storytelling</a> program through Ohio University. I traveled with a group of twenty other students and two professors to learn about film and storytelling as well as the people and places of County Donegal. After dividing into four smaller groups, each focusing on an individual documentary, three other students and I had only six weeks to get to know our subjects, conduct interviews, create a script, and edit the piece together. This was the first time that I had ever been involved in creating a documentary and it was a rapid pace, but highly rewarding, learning experience.

    	After meeting a couple of times and discovering a shared interest in art, my group decided to focus on what makes County Donegal a special place for any kind of art. We had a topic, but we had to work on narrowing it down to something more tangible. As we began meeting more people, we discovered that Donegal's isolated geographic location offers a special community that promotes and embraces the arts. Our documentary became a piece that highlights three individuals that share similar passions for the community of creativity that makes Donegal a special place.

    	I have to thank all of our subjects, Adrian, Redmond, and Little John Nee, as well as all of our friends in Letterkenny and around Donegal. I learned so much about the county, the country, and the people - some of the most welcoming and generous people I have ever met.
