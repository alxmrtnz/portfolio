		I have been working closely with <a href="http://www.sundriessolutions.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylaunch">Sundries Solutions</a>, a Columbus based software development and IT services company, on redesigning a web application service for <a href="http://primemedicalresources.com/" target="_blank" class="bodylaunch">Prime Medical Resources</a>. 
    </p>

    Having recently become extremely interested in designing UI elements, this project has been great as it has allowed me to toy with every subtle stroke, drop shadow, and gradient that allows the creation of clean, yet interesting, UI elements.

        The application allows the user to add potential client leads- their company information, contact information and more. My goal was to modernize the aesthetic as well as rearrange some of the key components for a better user experience. Some button were taken away, while the "Add Lead" and "Quick Create" options were given more prominence in order to reinforce the goal of the page: adding and organizing leads. 
     </p>
        <p class="margintopparagraph">I also worked on cleaning up the ways you can organize the lead information table by putting more emphasis on the search bar and filter options.

    <h3 class="process"> Leads Detail Page </h3>

    </a>
   
    
    <p>
        This page gives detailed information about each lead contact. I was able to redesign several icons on the page to add better meaning to some of the page's actions. I also added a breadcrumb at the top to show the user how they arrived at the page and reorganized several of the tables throughout the page</p>
