		This piece was creating during the summer of 2012 in County Donegal, Ireland as part of the <a href="http://ohioireland.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" class="launch">Ohio University Documentary Storytelling</a> study abroad program. Our prompt for this assignment was to create a short piece using only video and ambient sound. This piece documents our attemped trip to Tory Island, a small island nine miles off of the northern coast of Ireland. Unfortunately, the ferry that was supposed to take us out to the island was cancelled due to inclement weather. Regardless, we were able to create this little piece to remember the experience.
