		An infographic which I created based off of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/realestate/mortgages-factoring-in-commuting-costs.html?hp&_r=0" target="_blank" class="launch">New York Times</a> article on factoring commuting costs into the cost of living. The infographic was designed with the intention of being viewed on the web.

        I played around representing statistics through illustrations of clouds, hot air balloons and other forms of transportation. I wanted to bring attention to how transportation costs can drastically increase or reduce the cost of living in an area. It's something that many people don't consider when searching for a place to live.
