	<p class="margintopparagraph">
		Being my first responsive site, I learned much about designing for many different devices and using media queries to change each page's layout via CSS. I also implemented some CSS3 animations for the clouds on the homepage and learned more about new 3D transforms.

		The site is promoting a ticket running for the Ohio University Student Senate called Voice. The goal of the project was to create a site that could showcase the party's platform and candidates in order to reach out to students.
