									<h3>Energy Conservation on New South</h3>

								<div class="tenantDescription">
									<p>As new south is being planned and constructed, there&apos;s an opportunity for Ohio University to become more energy efficient than it has ever been. As the Student Senate, VOICE will advocate for the newest energy conservation technology, increasing Ohio University&apos;s sustainability.  Housing&apos;s ten year plan is the biggest project the University has taken on, it will completely change the look of this campus and VOICE will make sure OHIO becomes energy efficient as it grows.</p>

									<h3>Green Event Checklist</h3>

								<div class="tenantDescription">VOICE is committed to a cleaner, healthier, less wasteful campus. In an effort to demonstrate our commitment to students and the environment, we have developed a 2013-2014 Green Event Planning Guide to help reduce the environmental footprint (impact) of events hosted by Student Senate, Student Organizations, Residential Life, and students. The Guide includes tips to help event planners increase recycling rates, reduce energy consumption, and minimize waste. Shifting away from unsustainable events will help the University meet the goals outlined in the Climate Action Plan and Sustainability Plan.</div>

								<div class="tenantDescription">
									<p>Student Senate plays a key role in providing a diverse environment at Ohio University.

VOICE has developed a mentoring program designed for international students. International upperclassman will mentor incoming freshmen through their first year at Ohio University and the United States of America.

									<h3>Expansion of Gender Neutral Housing</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="tenantDescription">Recognizing that the current Gender Neutral Housing (GNH) community houses a small percentage of students, we want to increase awareness about this housing option in order to attract students that feel this community is fitting.<br>
								First of all, we plan on speaking to parties most involved with GNH; this includes residents, those who work with the community, and administrators in Residential Housing. We recognize that they know what is best for the community and that their input is vital. Secondly, we want to work with Admissions to promote awareness of GNH, in the hopes that promoting this community will generate interest and increase knowledge about this housing option. Thirdly, we want to educate the current Ohio University community about GNH. Studentsâ€™ knowledge of GNH will help foster respect and a shared knowledge of GNH. We plan to educate students by advocating for learning communities to discuss GNH, talking to student organizations, placing promotional and educational materials in classrooms, and proactively speaking to students and administrators. <br>
								If our efforts or the efforts of others result in the need for expansion of GNH, we will call on Residential Housing to offer more rooms. Furthermore, we will actively push for the Housing Maser Plan to offer a new site for the GNH community. We, as a ticket, will fight for GNH to always be present at Ohio University.<br>
								Through promotion, education, and awareness, we hope to strengthen Gender Neutral Housing, all in the hopes of making Ohio University a safer and more welcoming home for all Bobcats.

									<h3>Language Campaign</h3>

VOICE will work with the Baker Advisory Board throughout the year to make sure students are being heard when it comes to Baker renovations. Voice also plans to work closely with programing boards to make sure Baker is being utilized as a hotspot for student activities.

									<h3>Outreach</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="tenantDescription">Voice will increase the amount of student-to-student interaction throughout the year. It is very important to us that students on campus are aware of what Senate Appropriations Commission (SAC) does. This commission gives out general fee dollars to student organizations for programming on campus. In order to create more student interaction, we will create workshops that will be held on Monday and Wednesday of week 5. The purpose of the week 5 workshops is to allow student organizations, who are applying for funding, to come in and ask questions about their SAC PACs that are due on that Friday. We will also increase our student outreach with more tabling around Baker Center and increased advertising. Finally, it is our goal to help students understand where their general fee dollars are going. Our outreach to students will include how their money is being spent on programming on our campus.</div>

							<div class="platformTenant">

									<h3>Increased Programming and Transparency</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="tenantDescription">With increased outreach and student awareness, Voice will push for more programming from student organizations.

									<h3>Technology Committee</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="tenantDescription">In collaboration with OIT, VOICE will establish a technology committee.  This committee will include students and staff alike, to make sure Ohio University is using its technology resources most effectively to benefit the students.  Issues like dorm room Wi-Fi and library printing are things that students face every day, and therefore should have a say in how they are handled.</div>

									<h3>Effective Student Organization Representation</h3>

									<h3>Bus Expansion</h3>

								<div class="tenantDescription">As the overall size of this university continues to grow and the availability of transportation remains rather stagnant, Voice firmly believes in expanding the capabilities of the Athens bus transit. Voice will push for a larger bus route that will continue to operate later than 2am. Ohio University must accommodate for the needs of students.</div>

									<h3>The Return of the Spring Concert</h3>
